# Data visualization with different Charts:

1. Line Charts:

plt.plot: Shows trends and relationships over time or another continuous variable.
Use cases: Time series analysis, comparing multiple datasets, visualizing function behavior.

2. Bar Charts:

plt.bar: Compares discrete categories, their values, and distributions.
Use cases: Categorical data analysis, comparing proportions, highlighting outliers.

3. Histograms:

plt.hist: Shows the distribution of a continuous variable.
Use cases: Understanding data spread, identifying skewness, comparing multiple distributions.

4. Scatter Plots:

plt.scatter: Shows relationships between two continuous variables.
Use cases: Identifying correlations, detecting clusters and outliers, visualizing multi-dimensional data.

5. Pie Charts:

plt.pie: Shows proportions of different categories within a whole.
Use cases: Emphasizing dominant categories, comparing parts to a whole, visualizing simple breakdowns.

6. Box Plots:

plt.boxplot: Shows the distribution of a variable across groups or samples.
Use cases: Comparing medians and quartiles, identifying outliers, detecting differences between groups.

7. Area Plots:

plt.fill_between: Shows the cumulative sum of a function over an interval.
Use cases: Visualizing trends with uncertainty, highlighting areas of interest, stacking multiple series.

8. Subplots:

plt.subplots: Creates multiple plots within a single figure.
Use cases: Comparing multiple variables, visualizing relationships between different data sets, organizing complex visualizations.
